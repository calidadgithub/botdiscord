## Run the bot yourself


Continue with the following steps.

<p>To run Javascript code outside of a webpage, you need <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>.
Download it, install it, and make sure it works in a terminal (or Command Prompt, as all of this should work 
on Windows systems). The default command is “node.”</p>
 
 
<p>You also will need installing the &nbsp;<a href="https://discord.js.org/#/">Discord.js</a> module to interact with the Discord API.You can install it by running the following command:</p>

<pre>npm install discord.js</pre>

<p>You’ll need a text editor. You could just use notepad, but we recommend either <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSC</a>.</p>
 
<p>You also will need installing the &nbsp;<a href="https://hypercoder2975.github.io/simple-youtube-api/master/index.html">Youtube simple API </a>.This library is designed to greatly simplify interacting with the basic functions of the YouTube API. It deals with viewing/searching videos, playlists, and channels this will be needed to some of our commands.
You can install it by running the following command: .</p>

<pre>npm install simple-youtube-api</pre>

<p>Head over to your terminal, and run the following command at the path of the project: </p>

<pre>node BenderBot.js</pre>
